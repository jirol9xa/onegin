 
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; 
And enterprises of great pith and moment 
And lose the name of action. â€“ Soft you now! 
And makes us rather bear those ills we have 
And thus the native hue of resolution 
Be all my sins remember'd. 
But that the dread of something after death, 
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; 
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, 
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, 
Must give us pause: there's the respect 
No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
No traveller returns, puzzles the will 
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
Than fly to others that we know not of? 
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation 
That makes calamity of so long life; 
That patient merit of the unworthy takes, 
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons 
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks 
The insolence of office and the spurns 
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, 
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, 
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn 
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; 
To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
To grunt and sweat under a weary life, 
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; 
When he himself might his quietus make 
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, 
With this regard their currents turn awry,
