 
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; 
No more; and by a sleep to say we end 
Be all my sins remember'd. 
That makes calamity of so long life; 
To grunt and sweat under a weary life, 
When he himself might his quietus make 
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, 
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
And makes us rather bear those ills we have 
Than fly to others that we know not of? 
But that the dread of something after death, 
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; 
No traveller returns, puzzles the will 
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation 
To be, or not to be: that is the question: 
And thus the native hue of resolution 
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn 
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; 
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; 
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
That patient merit of the unworthy takes, 
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks 
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons 
The insolence of office and the spurns 
Must give us pause: there's the respect 
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, 
And enterprises of great pith and moment 
And lose the name of action. â€“ Soft you now! 
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, 
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, 
With this regard their currents turn awry,
